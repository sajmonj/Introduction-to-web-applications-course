 # React
 "React" in the first place does the same thing as "JSON", but (as the name suggest) using React. Moreover it allows user to change the name of a product from the list. It should also contain simple login process with JWT authentication and password hashing, but some problems and lack of time occur, and the only thing it does is simply redirecting from login page to "protected" page when user enters the "test" username and password.

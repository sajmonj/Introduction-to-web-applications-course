# Introduction-to-web-applications-course
Repository contains my student projects made on the Introduction to web applications course. 
* "Mikro-project" is a static website about driving school. 
* "JSON" is about taking data from JSON file and displaying them on the web page in the list form. Required functionalities: filtering and sorting data. 
* "Zombie Game" is a simple shooter game. Zombies are running (or levitating) on the screen and player's duty is to shoot them before they reach screen's left border. At first player has 3 lifes and 30 points. Every "living after screentime" zombie cost 1 life. Every good shoot is +10 points and every bad shoot is -3 points. When number of points drops below 0, player looses all remaining lifes and game ends.  
 * "Microservices" are just three simple projects aimed at creating small microservice. We used three technologies: SpringBoot, Flask and Express.
 * "React" in the first place does the same thing as "JSON", but (as the name suggest) using React. Moreover it allows user to change the name of a product from the list. It should also contain simple login process with JWT authentication and password hashing, but some problems and lack of time occur, and the only thing it does is simply redirecting from login page to "protected" page when user enters the "test" username and password. So redirecting itself is working, but the "protected" page doesn't (it's empty even though due to the code is shouldn't, idk what's going on).

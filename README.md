# Introduction-to-web-applications-course
Repository contains my student projects made on the Introduction to web applications course. 
* "Mikro-project" is a static website about driving school. 
* "JSON" is about taking data from JSON file and displaying them on the web page in the list form. Required functionalities: filtering and sorting data. 
* "Zombie Game" is a simple shooter game. Zombies are running (or levitating) on the screen and player's duty is to shoot them before they reach screen's left border. At first player has 3 lifes and 30 points. Every "living after screentime" zombie cost 1 life. Every good shoot is +10 points and every bad shoot is -3 points. When number of points drops below 0, player looses all remaining lifes and game ends.  
 * "Microservices" are just three simple projects aimed at creating small microservice. We used three technologies: SpringBoot, Flask and Express. Express isn't fully working, because of problems with adding new data to database.
